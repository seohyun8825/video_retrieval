So, I need to find the most relevant video to the query about a female weight lifter bending at the knees, lifting a barbell to her chest, then over her head, and dropping it to the ground.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the candidates one by one. Each candidate is a video, and I need to check if they match the description.\n\nCandidate 1: The video shows a woman lifting a barbell. She bends at the knees, lifts it to her chest, then over her head. Wait, the description says she bends at the knees, lifts to chest, then over head, then drops. Let me check the timestamps. The first part of the video shows her bending, lifting to chest, then over head. The last part is dropping. The video seems to match the query. The background has an American flag and some banners, but the main action is the weightlifting.\n\nCandidate 2: This one starts with a black screen, then shows a woman lifting a barbell. Wait, the description says she bends at the knees, lifts to chest, over head, drops. But the video here shows her lifting the barbell, but maybe the sequence is different. Wait, the video starts with a black screen, then shows a woman lifting. But the description mentions bending at the knees, which might be part of the lift.

So maybe not relevant.\n\nCandidate 2: The video starts with a black screen, then shows a group of people in a stadium. Wait, the description says \"several girls in a big stadium on the field.\" The video shows people in a stadium, but the first part is a black screen.

The description says \"hits a ball with a stick,\" but in the video, it's a soccer game.

Wait, the query says \"hits a ball with a stick,\" but the video might be a different sport. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, the query mentions \"a girl hits a ball with a stick she is holding.\" So the action is hitting a ball with a stick.

Wait, the query mentions wrapping white toilet paper. Let me check again. The query says \"wraps white toilet paper on a pumpkin carving.\" So in candidate [1], there's a part where he's wrapping toilet paper. Also, the video shows him carving a face.

The description says \"a guy is removing the skin off a pumpkin. The guy sits and discusses. The guy is carving unique face...\" So maybe the video has a part where he's sitting.

However, the query also says \"the guy sits and discusses.\" Does candidate [2] have that? The description says \"a guy is carving a pumpkin, then looks in a mirror.\" Wait, the video description for candidate [2] is: \"a guy is carving a pumpkin, then looks in a mirror.\" But the query mentions \"sits and discusses.\" Hmm, maybe the video doesn't have the sitting part.

The description mentions \"a large crowd of students is watching a person doing flips and throwing her baton over the floor.\" The video shows a gym with a crowd. The sequence has flips and baton throws. The query also mentions \"the girl then moves to the other side of the gym and grabs fire sticks.\" Wait, but Candidate 1's video doesn't mention fire sticks. Wait, the query says \"grabs fire sticks\"", "pred_order": [], "top1_correct": false, "gt_pos": 0, "index": 16}

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query describes two men kickboxing inside a building. One holds up a block while the other kicks and punches. Then, the first man turns, and another man kicks and punches at the blocks.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each candidate video and see which one matches the description. Let's go through each candidate one by one.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video shows two men in a boxing gym. They're throwing punches and kicks. The description mentions a block, so maybe they're using a block. Wait, the query says one man holds up a block. Let me check the video. The first part shows them in a gym, and the second part might have a block. Wait, the video starts with them in a gym, and the description says one holds up a block. Hmm, maybe the block is part of the action. Let me check the timestamps. The video starts with them in a gym, and the action continues. The query mentions \"one man holds up a block as the other is kicking and punching.\" So, in the video, maybe one person is holding a block while the other is attacking. Let's see the frames. The first few seconds show them in a gym, and then maybe the block is involved. Wait, the video description says \"One man holds up a block as the other is kicking and punching.\" So, the block is being held by one man, and the other is kicking/punching. Then, the first man turns, and another man kicks and punches at the blocks. Wait, the query says \"He then turns, and another man kicks and punches at the blocks.\" So, the first man turns, and another man is doing the same. Wait, but the query says \"one man holds up a block as the other is kicking and punching. He then turns, and another man kicks and punches at the blocks.\" So, the first man is holding the block, the second is kicking/punching. Then, the first man turns, and another man (maybe the same or different?) kicks and punches at the blocks. Wait, maybe the first man is the one holding the block, then turns, and another man is doing the same. Wait, the query says \"He then turns, and another man kicks and punches at the blocks.\" So, the first man (who was holding the block) turns, and another man (maybe the same as the first?) is kicking and punching at the blocks. Wait, maybe the two men are the same? No, the query says \"two men\" so two different people. Wait, the query says \"Two men are kickboxing inside a building.\" So, two men. One holds up a block, the other is kicking/punching. Then, the first man turns, and another man (maybe the same as the first?) kicks and punches at the blocks. Wait, maybe the first man is the one holding the block, then turns, and another man (the second man) is kicking and punching at the blocks. Wait, the query says \"He then turns, and another man kicks and punches at the blocks.\" So, the first man (who was holding the block) turns, and another man (the second man) is kicking and punching at the blocks. Wait, but the query says \"two men\" so maybe the first man is the one holding the block, and the second man is the one kicking/punching. Then, the first man turns, and another man (maybe the same as the second?) kicks and punches at the blocks. Wait, maybe the first man is the one holding the block, then turns, and the second man is the one kicking/punching.

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query says: \"A few boys stand around doing different things in a locker room. One boy kicks and spins around showing off his martial art skills.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the query is describing. It mentions a locker room setting where a few boys are doing various activities. One specific boy is kicking and spinning, showcasing martial arts skills.\n\nNow, looking at the candidates. Each candidate is a video, and I need to check which one matches the description best.\n\nLet's go through each candidate:\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a locker room scene. There are boys in white uniforms, some with belts. They seem to be doing martial arts moves. The sequence shows them in a line, some doing kicks and spins. The description mentions \"martial art skills\" which matches the query. Also, the setting is a locker room, which fits the first part of the query.\n\nCandidate [2]: This video shows a man in a blue shirt doing some moves in a gym. There's a person in a white shirt, but it's not clear if it's a locker room. The activities seem more like general exercise or maybe basketball, but not sure. The description doesn't mention martial arts or a locker room. So probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate [3]: This video shows people in red shirts doing some exercises. It's a gym setting, but the activities look like boxing or martial arts. Wait, the description says \"Core Fight Academy\" which might be a martial arts school. However, the video shows people doing moves like kicks and spins. But the setting is a gym, not a locker room. The query specifies a locker room, so maybe this isn't the right one.\n\nCandidate [4]: This is a group of girls in blue uniforms doing some kind of dance or cheerleading. The setting is a gym, but the activities are more like dance routines. The query mentions boys, so this is probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate [5]: This video shows a group of people in white shirts doing some activities. One person is kicking, but it's not clear if it's a locker room. The setting is a gym, and the activities might be related to martial arts, but the description doesn't specify a locker room. Also, the video has some Japanese text, which might be a clue, but the main point is the setting and the activities.\n\nWait, the query says \"a few boys stand around doing different things in a locker room. One boy kicks and spins around showing off his martial art skills.\"\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n- Locker room setting\n- Boys (so male participants)\n- Different activities (some boys are doing various things)\n- One boy specifically kicking and spinning, showing martial arts skills.\n\nLooking at candidate [1], the description says \"a few boys stand around doing different things in a locker room. One boy kicks and spins around showing off his martial art skills.\" The video shows boys in white uniforms, some with belts, doing martial arts moves. The setting is a locker room, which matches. The specific action of kicking and spinning is also present.\n\nCandidate [3] is a gym setting, but the video shows people doing martial arts. However, the setting is a gym, not a locker room. The query specifies \"locker room,\" so [1] is more accurate.\n\nCandidate [5] has a person kicking, but the setting is a gym, not a locker room. Also, the participants are girls, so not relevant.\n\nCandidate [2] is a gym, but the activities are more like general exercise, not martial arts.\n\nCandidate [4] is girls doing dance, so not relevant.\n\nSo the most relevant candidate is [1].\n</think>\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "pred_order": [1], "top1_correct": false, "gt_pos": 0, "index": 19}

The query describes a man speaking to the camera while holding a bottle of lotion, spreading it on a woman's hair, brushing it, blow-drying it, and styling it into a certain look. The woman then sees herself in the mirror.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each candidate video and see which one matches the description. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with \"Hair Basics\" text. Then there's a man in a black shirt holding a bottle of lotion, spreading it on a woman's hair. He then brushes and blow-dries the hair. The woman is in a mirror, showing the styled hair. Wait, the description mentions the man speaking to the camera while holding a bottle of lotion. In this video, the man is holding a bottle (lotion) and spreading it on the woman's hair. Then he brushes and blow-dries. The woman is in the mirror. That seems to match the query.\n\nCandidate 2: The video starts with \"GLAMOUR\" text. Then a man is styling a woman's hair. He's using a brush and maybe a blow-dryer. But the description mentions the man speaking to the camera. In this video, the man is not speaking; he's just styling. The query says \"a man is seen speaking to the camera\". So maybe this isn't the right one.\n\nCandidate 3: The video shows a woman with curly hair being styled. A person is braiding her hair. But there's no mention of a man speaking to the camera or using a lotion bottle. The description is about styling hair, but the man isn't involved here. So probably not.\n\nCandidate 4: The video starts with \"Howcast\" text. A man is styling a woman's hair. He's using a brush and maybe a blow-dryer. Again, the man isn't speaking to the camera. The query mentions the man speaking, so this might not fit.\n\nCandidate 5: This video shows a man getting a haircut. A woman is cutting his hair. The description is about styling hair, but the main action here is a haircut. The query is about styling into a certain look, not cutting. So this is probably not relevant.\n\nSo, Candidate 1 seems to fit the description. Let me check again. The query says the man is speaking to the camera while holding a bottle of lotion. In Candidate 1, the man is holding a bottle (lotion) and spreading it on the woman's hair. Then he brushes and blow-dries. The woman is in the mirror. The video starts with \"Hair Basics\" which might indicate it's about hair styling. The other candidates don't have the man speaking to the camera part. Candidate 2 has a man styling but no speaking. Candidate 4 is Howcast, which is a tutorial, but the man isn't speaking. Candidate 5 is a haircut. So Candidate 1 is the best match.\n</think>\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "pred_order": [1], "top1_correct": true, "gt_pos": 1, "index": 18}

Let's go through each candidate one by one.\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a black-and-white scene of ice hockey. It shows players moving, then a player falling, being helped up, and then some action. The description mentions \"a man fell on the ice, then men help to stand the player. The players hit each other hard and push and the red team score, then the team jumps.\" This seems to match the query's first part. The video shows a fall, help, scoring, and jumping. But wait, the video is in black and white, which might be an older game. However, the key events here are the fall, help, scoring, and jumping. The query also mentions \"other teams play ice jockey and a man get injured, then the team play and win.\" But in Candidate 1, it's only one team's action. Wait, the query says \"two teams play ice jockey\" so maybe the video shows two teams.

The first part is two teams playing, a man falls, helps up, hits hard, red team scores, team jumps. Then other teams play, a man gets injured, team wins. Then a man talks on microphone. Then another instance of two teams playing with a man falling.\n\nLooking at Candidate 1: The video starts with a black-and-white scene of ice hockey. It shows players moving, then a player falling, being helped up, and then some action. The description mentions \"a man fell on the ice, then men help to stand the player. The players hit each other hard and push and the red team score, then the team jumps.\" So the first part of the query is covered here.

The query also mentions \"other teams play ice jockey and a man get injured, then the team play and win.\" But Candidate 1's video might not have the other teams. Wait, the video description for Candidate 1 says it's a black-and-white video of ice hockey.

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query describes several shots of people performing jump roping tricks on a large stage in front of an audience. They do jumps and tricks with each other and by themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each candidate video and see which one matches the description best.\n\nStarting with candidate [1]: The video starts with a grassy field, a tent, and a crowd. Then there's a person jumping rope. Wait, the description mentions a large stage in front of an audience. But this video seems to be on a grassy field, maybe a park. The first part shows a crowd, but the main action is a person jumping rope. However, the query specifies a large stage, so maybe this isn't the right one. Let me check the other candidates.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video starts with a black screen, then shows people doing jump rope tricks on a stage. The description says \"people performing jump roping tricks on a large stage in front of an audience.\" The video shows multiple people doing jump rope tricks, some with each other and individually. The background has an audience, which matches the query. The title says \"Super Skippers\" and \"carry family ymca,\" which might be a gym or club. The video shows various jump rope moves, including tricks. This seems very close.\n\nCandidate [3]: This is about standing high jump practice. The video shows a person jumping over a bar, but it's a high jump, not jump roping. So this is definitely not relevant.\n\nCandidate [4]: The video starts with a black screen, then shows a person doing jump rope in a gym. Wait, the description says \"jump roping tricks on a large stage.\" The video shows a gym setting, but the audience is not mentioned. The video shows people doing jump rope, but the setting is indoors. The query mentions a large stage in front of an audience, so maybe the gym isn't a stage. Also, the title says \"Cup of Club,\" which might be a competition, but the main action is in a gym. Not sure if it's a stage.\n\nCandidate [5]: The video shows people doing jump rope tricks on a stage. The description mentions \"people performing jump roping tricks on a large stage in front of an audience.\" The video shows multiple people doing jump rope, some with each other and individually. The background has an audience, and the setting is a stage. The title says \"Rope Skippers\" and \"Spontaneous Champs,\" which might be a competition. The video shows various jump rope tricks, including tricks with each other. This seems to match the query.\n\nWait, but candidate [2] and [5] both seem to fit. Let me check again.\n\nCandidate [2] is \"Super Skippers carry family ymca\" and shows people doing jump rope tricks on a stage. The video has multiple people, some doing tricks with each other. The setting is a stage with an audience.\n\nCandidate [5] is \"Rope Skippers Spontaneous Champs\" and shows people doing jump rope tricks on a stage. The video shows people doing tricks, including with each other. The title mentions \"Spontaneous Champs,\" which might imply a competition, but the main action is jump rope.\n\nWait, the query says \"several shots are shown of people performing jump roping tricks on a large stage in front of an audience.\" So the key points are: jump roping tricks, large stage, audience.\n\nLooking at candidate [2], the video starts with a stage with an audience, people doing jump rope tricks. The description says \"people do several jumps and tricks with each other as well as by themselves.\" The video shows multiple people doing tricks, so that matches.\n\nCandidate [5] also shows people doing jump rope tricks on a stage. The video has a title that says \"Spontaneous Champs,\" which might be a competition, but the main action is jump rope. The description mentions \"people performing jump roping tricks on a large stage in front of an audience.\" So both [2] and [5] seem relevant.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"output only the index of the most relevant video.\" So which one is more relevant?\n\nLet me check the details again.\n\nCandidate [2] has a title \"Super Skippers carry family ymca\" and the video shows people doing jump rope tricks on a stage.

Wait, the first part of the description says \"the little girl is wearing pink princess costume\". But looking at the video description, it shows a girl in a pink dress, but the costume is described as pink princess. Wait, the query mentions \"pink princess costume\" and \"Wonder Woman costume\". Let me check the video. The first video (candidate 1) shows a girl in a pink dress, but the description says \"pink princess costume\". Hmm, maybe the costume is pink princess. But the video shows a girl in a pink dress, which might be the same. However, the video also mentions other elements like a rainbow-colored structure, which might not be relevant. The main activity here is kids playing outside, but the query specifies hopscotch.

It's about two people arm wrestling on a mat, locking arms, pushing hard, and fighting until one wins. So, the key elements here are arm wrestling, two participants, a mat, locking arms, pushing, and a decisive win.\n\nNow, looking at the candidates. Each candidate is a video, and I need to check which one matches the query best.\n\nLet's go through each candidate:\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a couple of arm wrestlers on a mat. They lock arms and push hard. The description mentions \"a couple of arm wrestlers\" which matches the query. The video shows them fighting until one wins. The timestamps go from 0.2 to 7.2 seconds, which seems to capture the action. The first part of the video shows them on the mat, locking arms, pushing, and then the outcome. So this seems like a perfect match.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video starts with \"A man and a woman are arm wrestling.\" Wait, the query says \"a couple of arm wrestlers,\" which could be two people. But the description here says \"a man and a woman,\" so that's a couple. However, the video shows them in a room with a table, and they're arm wrestling. But the query mentions \"on a mat,\" but the video here is in a room with a table. Wait, the query says \"on a mat,\" but the video might not be on a mat. Wait, the description says \"on a mat\" in the query, but the video in candidate [2] is in a room with a table. Hmm, maybe the mat isn't visible here. Wait, the video description for [2] says \"a man and a woman are arm wrestling\" but the setting is a room with a table. Maybe the mat isn't present here. Wait, the query specifies \"on a mat,\" so if the video is in a room with a table, maybe it's not on a mat. But the query says \"on a mat,\" so maybe this candidate isn't the best.\n\nWait, the query says \"on a mat,\" so the video must show them on a mat. Let's check the description again. Candidate [2] says \"a man and a woman are arm wrestling\" but the setting is a room with a table. The video might not be on a mat. So maybe this isn't the best.\n\nCandidate [3]: The video shows two people arm wrestling on a mat. Wait, the description says \"two people arm wrestling on a mat.\" The video starts with them on a mat, locking arms, pushing. The timestamps go from 0.2 to 7.2 seconds. So this seems to match the query. The query mentions \"on a mat,\" which is present here. Also, they lock arms and push hard, fighting until one wins. So this is a good candidate.\n\nWait, but the query says \"a couple of arm wrestlers,\" which could be two people. Candidate [3] has two people, so that's good. Candidate [1] also has two people. Wait, but let's check the details.\n\nWait, the query says \"a couple of arm wrestlers,\" which is two people. So both [1] and [3] have two people.

So that's also good.\n\nWait, but the query says \"they lock arms and push hard. They keep fighting until one of them wins.\" So both [1] and [3] have that. Let's check the details.\n\nWait, candidate [1] is labeled as [1] video: starts with a couple of arm wrestlers on a mat. They lock arms and push hard. They keep fighting until one wins. The video shows them in a gym setting, with other people in the background.

Let's go through each candidate one by one.\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with \"Standing High Jump Practice June 2, 2011\". Then it shows a person doing high jumps, not slacklining. The description mentions slack line activities, so this is probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate 2: This one starts with \"The Curbing 50\" and some text. It looks like it's about a curling event, maybe a sports video. The activities here are curling, not slacklining. So this is not relevant.\n\nCandidate 3: The video starts with \"WASHEURN 2011\" and shows people in a river. It seems to be about river activities, maybe kayaking or something. Not related to slacklining.\n\nCandidate 4: This is about sharpening knives in India. The video shows a person sharpening knives. The query is about slacklining, so this is irrelevant.\n\nCandidate 5: The video starts with \"Lifeloods INDIA\" and shows a person doing a jump. Wait, the description says \"a guy flips off a slack line and lands on his body. A man walks on a slack line and falls off. A person does flips around the slack line.

A man walks on a slack line and falls off. A person does flips around the slack line. A male flips off a brown, picnic table.\" So the candidate 5 video shows a person doing flips around the slack line. Wait, but the video description for candidate 5 says: \"A person does flips around the slack line.\" Wait, maybe the video is about slacklining. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the candidate 5 video description: \"A person does flips around the slack line.\" Wait, but the query mentions \"a guy flips off a slack line and lands on his body. A man walks on a slack line and falls off. A person does flips around the slack line. A male flips off a brown, picnic table.\" So the key here is that the video should have slacklining activities. Let's check the candidate 5 video. The description says: \"A person does flips around the slack line.\" Wait, but the video description for candidate 5 is: \"A person does flips around the slack line.\" Wait, maybe the video is about slacklining. Wait, but the query also mentions \"a male flips off a brown, picnic table.\" So the video should have a person flipping off a picnic table.

Let me check the actual video description.\n\nWait, the candidate 5 video description: \"A person does flips around the slack line.\" Wait, but the query says \"a male flips off a brown, picnic table.\" So the video should have a person flipping off a picnic table.

Let's go through each one.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video shows someone washing dishes in a sink. There's a green basin, maybe a colander, and they're washing utensils. No cooking tools being spun around a pan, and no serving food. So this doesn't fit.\n\nCandidate [2]: A chef in a white uniform is cooking. The video shows the chef handling a pan, maybe frying something. The chef is using a pan, but the description mentions spinning around food on a pan. Wait, the query says \"spinning around food on a pan.\" Does the chef in this video spin the food? Let me check the timestamps. The video starts with the chef preparing a dish, maybe adding ingredients, then moving around the pan. The description says \"spinning around food on a pan.\" Maybe the chef is stirring or rotating the food. Also, the chef is serving the food onto a plate. The video shows the chef placing the food on a plate, which matches the query's \"serves the food onto a plate.\" So this seems close.\n\nCandidate [3]: A person in a kitchen, handling a pan. They're putting something on the stove, maybe cooking. But the description mentions a large man holding two cooking tools. The video shows a person using a pan, but there's no mention of spinning around food. The person is using a pan, but the action of spinning might not be there. Also, the video ends with the person putting the pan on the stove, but no serving. So maybe not.\n\nCandidate [4]: A woman in a kitchen, making a sandwich. She's handling ingredients, but the video shows her preparing a sandwich, not cooking on a pan. The query mentions spinning around food on a pan, which isn't happening here. Also, the description says \"catching up with KATIE COURT\" which might be a segment, but the main action is making a sandwich. So this doesn't fit.\n\nCandidate [5]: A person applying adhesive to a floor. The video shows someone using a tool on the floor, maybe for flooring. No cooking tools, no pan, no serving food. So this is irrelevant.\n\nSo, Candidate [2] seems to match the most closely. The chef is handling a pan, spinning food (maybe stirring or rotating), and serving onto a plate. The other candidates don't have the spinning action or serving part. Let me double-check. The query says \"spinning around food on a pan.\" In the video [2], the chef is cooking, so maybe the action of spinning is part of the cooking process. The description says \"spinning around food on a pan,\" which could be stirring or rotating the food. The video shows the chef moving the pan, which might involve spinning. Also, the serving part is there. So yes, [2] is the best fit.\n</think>\n\n<answer>2</answer>", "pred_order": [2], "top1_correct": true, "gt_pos": 1, "index": 33}

The description says \"the group of people then throw a ball around the area while a person walks in and out of frame.\" So, the video shows people swimming, then a ball appears, and they throw it around. Also, a person walks in and out. So this seems to match the query.\n\nCandidate [2]: This video starts with a person walking in and out of frame. Then, there's a handshake, then a person in a suit. Wait, the description says \"a person walks in and out of frame.\" But the main activity here is people shaking hands, then a person in a suit. The video seems to be about a meeting or a business event, not swimming or throwing a ball. So this doesn't match.\n\nCandidate [3]: The video shows people in a pool, but they are wearing caps. The description says \"several people are seen swimming around a pool.\" Then, they throw a ball. Wait, the video description says \"a group of people then throw a ball around the area.\" So this might be a water polo game. But the query mentions \"throwing a ball around the area,\" which could be a different sport. However, the key here is whether the video shows people swimming and throwing a ball. The description for [3] says \"a group of people then throw a ball around the area.\" So this might be relevant. Wait, but the query says \"several people are seen swimming around a pool when a ball comes into frame.\" So the first part is swimming, then a ball comes in, then they throw it. So in [3], the video shows people swimming, then throwing a ball. But the query also mentions \"a person walks in and out of frame.\" Let me check the video description for [3]. The video description says \"a group of people then throw a ball around the area while a person walks in and out of frame.\" Wait, the video description for [3] is: \"a group of people then throw a ball around the area while a person walks in and out of frame.\" Wait, but the video description for [3] is a bit unclear. Let me check the actual video description.\n\nWait, the candidates are listed with their own descriptions. Let me re-read the candidates:\n\nCandidate [1] video: starts with people swimming, then a ball comes into frame, then they throw the ball around, and a person walks in and out.\n\nCandidate [2] video: starts with a person walking in and out, then a handshake, then a person in a suit.\n\nCandidate [3] video: starts with people swimming, then a ball comes into frame, then they throw the ball around.\n\nWait, the description for [3] says \"a group of people then throw a ball around the area while a person walks in and out of frame.\" So this seems to match the query.\n\nWait, but the query says \"several people are seen swimming around a pool when a ball comes into frame.\" So the first part is swimming, then the ball comes in. Then they throw the ball around. So both [1] and [3] have swimming and throwing a ball.\n\nWait, but the query also mentions \"a person walks in and out of frame.\" So in the video, there's a person walking in and out.

Hmm, maybe not.\n\nCandidate 3: This video shows a person using a mop and bucket. Wait, the description is about a paint brush.

But the video here shows a person in a room with shelves of paint supplies. Wait, the person is holding a brush, but is it in front of a canvas? Maybe.

Maybe not exactly the same.\n\nCandidate 5: This video shows a person sitting on the floor, using a brush on a canvas. Wait, the description says \"a man stands in front of a canvas holding a paint brush.\" So the person is standing in front of the canvas.

Wait, the description says \"dips the paint brush in a bucket and wipes it off on a towel.\" So the person is using a brush, dipping it in a bucket, wiping on a towel. Let me check the video description. The video starts with a person sitting on the floor, then using a brush on a canvas. Wait, the video shows a person using a brush on a canvas, but the description says \"dips the paint brush in a bucket and wipes it off on a towel.\" So maybe this is the one.

So, the task is to find the most relevant video among the candidates to the given query. The query describes a sequence of events: people tearing up a carpet in a store, moving it out, painting the floor gray, adding new gray carpet, and then vacuuming. There's also a mention of switching angles and another angle showing them ripping up and laying new carpet.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each candidate video and see if they match the described actions. Let's go through each candidate one by one.\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a room with people working on the floor. They're moving a carpet, then there's a scene where a man is laying down a new carpet. Wait, the description says \"tearing up the carpet in a store of some kind then move the carpet out and paint the floor gray.\" So, in this video, there's a sequence where they tear up the carpet, move it out, paint the floor, then add new carpet. The video shows people working on the floor, maybe in a store. The first part shows them tearing up the carpet, then moving it, painting, and then laying new carpet. The last part mentions vacuuming the new carpet. The video seems to fit the description.\n\nCandidate 2: This one shows a vacuum cleaner and some debris. The video starts with a person using a vacuum, then there's a close-up of a vacuum cleaner. The description mentions tearing up the carpet, moving it, painting, etc. But the video here is focused on vacuuming and maybe debris, which doesn't seem to match the sequence of tearing up and laying new carpet. The main action here is vacuuming, which is part of the process but not the entire sequence. So maybe not the best fit.\n\nCandidate 3: This video shows a large room with people working on the floor. It's a warehouse-like setting. The description mentions a store, but this might be a different type of space. The video shows people moving around, but the key part is the carpet being moved. However, the description mentions \"tearing up the carpet in a store of some kind,\" so maybe this is a store. But the video seems to be more about a warehouse. Wait, the description says \"a store of some kind,\" so maybe it's a store. But the video here shows a large open space with a lot of equipment, maybe a warehouse. The sequence of tearing up the carpet, moving it, painting, etc. But the video might not have the exact sequence. Let me check again. The video shows people moving around, but the key part is the carpet. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.\n\nCandidate 4: This video starts with a black screen, then shows a person laying down a carpet. The description mentions \"tearing up the carpet,\" but this video shows someone laying down a new carpet. Wait, the description says \"tearing up the carpet in a store of some kind then move the carpet out and paint the floor gray.\" So tearing up the carpet would be the first step. The video here shows a person laying down a new carpet, but the sequence is different. The video starts with a person placing a carpet, then there's a list of materials. Wait, the video shows a person placing a carpet, then a list of materials like concrete, vinyl, etc. The description mentions tearing up the carpet, moving it, painting, etc. So maybe this video is about laying new carpet, but the query is about tearing up and moving the old carpet. So this might not be the right one.\n\nCandidate 5: This video shows a man vacuuming a carpet. The description mentions \"a man vacuums\" at the end. But the query also mentions \"tearing up the carpet in a store of some kind then move the carpet out and paint the floor gray. The men then add gray carpet to the floor and a man vacuums.\" So the vacuuming part is part of the process. However, the video here is focused on vacuuming, which is the last part. But the query also mentions tearing up and laying new carpet. The video shows a man vacuuming a carpet, but the sequence of tearing up and laying new carpet isn't clear here. The video starts with a man vacuuming, but the description says they tear up the carpet first. So maybe this is not the right video.\n\nWait, let's go back to the query. The query says: \"People are tearing up the carpet in a store of some kind then move the carpet out and paint the floor gray. The men then add gray carpet to the floor and a man vacuums. We switch and see them rip up and lay new carpet from another angle. We see a man vacuuming the new carpet.\"\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. Tearing up the carpet (in a store)\n2.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a grassy area, then a person in a white shirt, and then a man in a yellow shirt. Wait, the description mentions kite surfing. But the first part of the video seems to be a grassy field, maybe a park, and then a person walking.

The video starts with 0.2 seconds, then 1.2 seconds, etc. But the description says the video starts with a swirl on a black title screen.

Wait, the description says \"A swirl appears on a black title screen\" but the candidate videos don't have that. Wait, the candidate videos are the actual videos. Wait, the problem says \"Each candidate is a video.\" So each candidate is a video, and the query is a description of what the video should contain.\n\nWait, the query is a description of the video content.

The description mentions \"a woman gets her hair brushed combed brushed and styled by an unseen person's hands.\" The video shows someone brushing the hair, which matches. Also, the camera captures the process from different angles, which is mentioned in the query. The salon setting seems relevant.\n\nCandidate [2]: This one starts with a title screen, then shows a person choosing roller size, then applying rollers.

The description says \"a woman gets her hair brushed combed brushed and styled by an unseen person's hands.\" The video shows a person styling hair, but the hands are visible.

So candidate [4] has both elements. Let's check the other candidates.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video shows a person on a roof with a nail gun, but does it have the red arrow? The first frame of candidate [2] is a black screen with \"SOUTHWEST ROOFING\" and then a roof with tiles. The next frames show a person on the roof. But the red arrow is not in candidate [2]. Wait, candidate [4] has a red arrow logo. Let's check the description of candidate [4]:\n\nCandidate [4] video: starts with a red arrow (the logo), then shows a person using a nail gun. So the query mentions \"a picture of a red arrow is shown\" (so the red arrow is part of the video) and \"a picture of a person kneeling down on a roof holding a nail gun\".

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the query: \"A video of scissor kick jumping at track is shown. A few people take turns at varying heights and all are successful. Others are running for other events in the background.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the query is describing. The key points here are:\n\n1. Scissor kick jumping at a track.\n2. People taking turns at varying heights, all successful.\n3. Others running for other events in the background.\n\nSo, the main elements are track events, scissor kick jumping (which is a type of jump, maybe a specific technique), multiple people attempting jumps at different heights, and other runners in the background.\n\nNow, looking at the candidates:\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a crowd, then shows a track with people jumping. Wait, the description says \"scissor kick jumping at track\". Let me check the timestamps. The first part of the video shows a track with people jumping. But the description mentions \"scissor kick jumping\", which is a specific jump. However, the video might be showing a different jump. Wait, the first video in the list (candidate 1) has a sequence where people are jumping over a bar or something. Wait, the first video description says \"a few people take turns at varying heights and all are successful.\" So maybe it's a jump event where they jump over a bar at different heights. But the query mentions \"scissor kick jumping\". Hmm, scissor kick is a specific technique, maybe a type of jump where the legs are bent in a scissor motion. But I'm not sure. Maybe the video shows a track event where people are doing jumps, but the specific technique isn't clear.\n\nCandidate 2: This one has \"Maya Douglas\" and \"Sprint\" events. The video shows a person doing a jump, but the description says \"scissor kick jumping\". Wait, the video starts with a person jumping over a bar, then another person. But the title says \"Sprint\" and \"Track\", but the description mentions \"scissor kick jumping\". Wait, the video is about a track event, but the specific jump technique isn't clear. However, the query mentions \"scissor kick jumping\", which might be a specific type of jump. But maybe the video shows a different jump.\n\nCandidate 3: This one is about \"Sumo Wrestler Foot-Race\" and \"Look at them go!\" with a photo finish. Wait, the description says \"Sumo Wrestler Foot-Race\", but the query is about track jumping. So this might not be relevant. The video shows a foot race, not a jump event.\n\nCandidate 4: This video shows a person doing a jump, but it's a track event. The description says \"a few people take turns at varying heights and all are successful.\" Wait, the video shows a person jumping over a bar, then another person. But the title says \"Sprint\" and \"Track\", but the specific jump technique isn't mentioned. However, the query mentions \"scissor kick jumping\", which might be a specific jump. But maybe the video is showing a different jump.\n\nCandidate 5: This video shows a person jumping over a bar, but the description says \"scissor kick jumping\". Wait, the video starts with a person jumping, then another. But the title says \"Sprint\" and \"Track\", but the specific jump technique isn't clear.\n\nWait, let's go back to the query. The key is \"scissor kick jumping at track\". So the video must show a track event where people are doing a scissor kick jump. Let's check each candidate:\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a crowd, then shows a track with people jumping. The description says \"a few people take turns at varying heights and all are successful.\" So this could be a jump event where people are jumping over a bar at different heights. But does it mention scissor kick? The description says \"scissor kick jumping\", but the video might not specify. However, the query says \"scissor kick jumping\", so maybe the video shows that specific technique.\n\nCandidate 2: The video has \"Maya Douglas\" and \"Sprint\" events. The description says \"scissor kick jumping\". Wait, the video shows a person jumping over a bar, but the title says \"Sprint\" and \"Track\". However, the description mentions \"scissor kick jumping\", which might be a specific jump. But the video might not be about that.\n\nWait, the query says \"scissor kick jumping at track\".

There are spectators watching, and the bikers take a huge leap and jump over an obstacle, landing on the other side.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each candidate video to see if they match the description.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a crowd watching, then shows bikers on a dirt track. There's a jump over an obstacle, and they land on the other side. The description mentions \"dirt bike competition,\" \"bikers taking a huge leap,\" and \"circular race track.\" The video seems to fit. The first few seconds show the crowd, then the bikers jumping. The track is circular, and they're doing jumps.\n\nCandidate [2]: This one shows a different event. It's a horse race with people riding horses. The description mentions \"dirt bike competition,\" but here it's horses. So this is not relevant. The video is about horse racing, not dirt bikes.\n\nCandidate [3]: This video shows a group of people, maybe a team, but it's not a competition. It's a group photo or something. The description is about a competition with bikers, but this video doesn't have any bikers or the race track. It's more about a team photo. So this is not relevant.\n\nCandidate [4]: This video shows people riding horses in a dirt arena. The description is about dirt bikes, so this is not relevant. The video is about horse racing, not bikes.\n\nCandidate [5]: This is a video of a person riding a bike on a dirt track, but it's a single rider. The description mentions \"several men\" and \"a circular race track.\" This video only shows one rider, so it's not the same as the query. The query mentions multiple bikers, but this video has one person. So this is not the right candidate.\n\nSo, comparing all candidates, only Candidate [1] matches the description of a dirt bike competition with multiple bikers, spectators, circular track, and a jump over an obstacle. The other candidates are either about horses, a team photo, or a single rider.

The video starts with a woman walking, then a close-up of her hair being braided. So maybe this is a candidate.\n\nCandidate [2]: This video starts with a woman getting her hair braided. The first frame shows a woman with her hair being braided by another woman. Then there's a close-up of the braiding process. The description says \"the top of a woman's head is seen.

So, I need to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query describes a chef speaking to the camera behind a kitchen counter, then cutting lettuce and pouring ingredients into a bowl. The man also presents more food items on a plate and a bowl next to it.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each candidate video to see which one matches the description.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a chef in a kitchen. The first few seconds show the chef cutting something on a cutting board. There's a bowl with ingredients around. The chef is handling lettuce, which matches the \"cutting up lettuce\" part. Then, the chef pours ingredients into a bowl. The description mentions \"pouring ingredients out into a bowl,\" which seems to fit. Also, there's a plate with more food items and a bowl next to it. The video shows the chef presenting food items, so this seems relevant.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video starts with a woman in a kitchen, but the first part shows her preparing vegetables. Wait, the description mentions a chef speaking to the camera. But in this candidate, the first part is a woman, not a chef. Then there's a scene where someone is cutting vegetables. However, the main part here is about a woman, not a chef. The query specifies a chef, so this might not be the right one.\n\nCandidate [3]: This video is about making a sandwich. The first part shows a chef putting ingredients on a sandwich. But the query mentions cutting lettuce and pouring ingredients into a bowl. The sandwich video doesn't have lettuce cutting or pouring into a bowl. It's more about assembling a sandwich. So this is probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate [4]: The video starts with a woman standing in front of a bookshelf. Then she's cutting cucumbers. Wait, the query is about a chef speaking to the camera. This candidate has a woman, not a chef. The main action here is cutting cucumbers, but the query mentions a chef. So this might not fit.\n\nCandidate [5]: The video starts with a chef in a kitchen. The chef is speaking to the camera. Then he's cutting vegetables. Wait, the description says \"a chef is seen speaking to the camera behind a kitchen counter and leads into him cutting up lettuce and pouring ingredients out into a bowl.\" The video starts with a chef speaking, which matches. Then it shows him cutting lettuce and pouring ingredients. The last part mentions presenting more food items on a plate and a bowl. The video shows the chef handling ingredients, cutting lettuce, and presenting food. So this seems to match the query.\n\nWait, let me check again. Candidate [5] starts with a chef speaking to the camera. Then he's cutting lettuce and pouring ingredients. The description says \"leads into him cutting up lettuce and pouring ingredients out into a bowl.\" The video shows the chef cutting lettuce (which is part of the query) and pouring ingredients into a bowl. Also, the query mentions \"the man presents more food items on a plate as well as a bowl sitting next to it.\" In the video, the chef is presenting food items on a plate and a bowl. So this seems to fit.\n\nCandidate [1] also shows a chef cutting lettuce and pouring ingredients. But the first part of candidate [1] is a chef speaking to the camera. Wait, the first part of candidate [1] is a black screen, then the chef starts. The description says \"a chef is seen speaking to the camera behind a kitchen counter.\" So the video starts with the chef speaking. Then it shows him cutting lettuce. So candidate [1] also seems to fit.\n\nWait, but the query says \"leads into him cutting up lettuce and pouring ingredients out into a bowl.\" So the sequence is: chef speaking, then cutting lettuce, then pouring. In candidate [1], the first part is the chef speaking, then cutting lettuce. Then pouring ingredients.

Then he's cutting vegetables. The description says \"leads into him cutting up lettuce and pouring ingredients out into a bowl.\" The video shows the chef cutting lettuce (which is part of the query) and pouring ingredients.

So, I need to figure out which video is the most relevant to the query: \"Words come on the screen before the video. Action figures are shown on a table. One of the action figures is knocked down.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the query into parts to understand what's being asked. The query mentions three key elements:\n\n1. Words come on the screen before the video.\n2. Action figures are shown on a table.\n3. One of the action figures is knocked down.\n\nNow, I need to look at each candidate video and see if they match these elements.\n\nLet's go through each candidate one by one.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a boxing ring. There are action figures (like a wrestler and a boxer) in a ring. The description says \"action figures are shown on a table\" but in this video, they're in a ring. Wait, the query says \"action figures are shown on a table,\" but in this video, they're in a ring. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the first part of the query says \"action figures are shown on a table,\" but in the video, they're in a boxing ring. So maybe this isn't matching. Let me check again. The video shows action figures in a ring, but the query mentions them on a table. So maybe this isn't the right one.\n\nCandidate [2]: This video starts with some text overlays. The first part shows \"British Olympic\" and \"Tibing 2004\" with Olympic logos. Then there's a gymnast doing flips. Wait, the query mentions words on the screen before the video. The first part of this video has text like \"British Olympic\" and \"Tibing 2004\" which are words on the screen. But the main content is gymnasts doing flips. The query also mentions action figures, but this video is about gymnasts. So maybe not relevant.\n\nCandidate [3]: This video shows a person playing a game with cups. There's a table with cups, and someone is playing a game. The description says \"action figures\" but in this video, it's a game with cups, not action figures. Wait, the query mentions action figures, but this video is about cups and a game. So maybe not.\n\nCandidate [4]: This video starts with \"Triplebomb by Unity\" and credits. Then it shows action figures. The description says \"action figures are shown on a table\" and \"one of the action figures is knocked down.\" Let's check. The video shows action figures (like a green one and a red one) on a table. Then one is knocked down. The first part of the video has \"Triplebomb by Unity\" which is a title, but the query mentions words on the screen before the video. Wait, the video starts with the title, which is text on the screen. So \"Triplebomb by Unity\" is text on the screen. Then the action figures are shown. So this matches the query's first part: words on screen before video. Then action figures on a table, and one knocked down. That seems to fit.\n\nCandidate [5]: This video shows a person using a timer. The person is adjusting a timer, and there's a digital display. The query mentions words on screen, but this video is about a timer and a person. There's no action figures here. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\n- Candidate [1]: Boxing ring with action figures, but they're in a ring, not on a table. The query says \"action figures are shown on a table,\" so this might not fit.\n- Candidate [2]: Gymnasts, no action figures, no words on screen (the text is part of the video, but the main content is gymnasts).\n- Candidate [3]: Cup game, no action figures.\n- Candidate [4]: Action figures on a table, words on screen (title), one knocked down. This seems to match.\n- Candidate [5]: Timer, no action figures.\n\nSo the most relevant candidate is [4].\n</think>\n\n<answer>4</answer>", "pred_order": [4], "top1_correct": true, "gt_pos": 1, "index": 63}

The video shows a person lifting weights, doing squats, deadlifts, etc. No mention of dance aerobics or gymnasium. So this is probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate [3]: This is about Powertrain, which is an exercise bike. The video shows someone on an elliptical machine, using a bike. The text mentions \"2 in 1 Treadmill Cross Trainer\" and \"Super Easy\". It's a fitness equipment video, but not dance aerobics. So not matching.\n\nCandidate [4]: This video starts with a green screen with a running figure, then shows a gymnasium with people doing dance aerobics.

So not relevant.\n\nSo, Candidate [4] is the only one that matches all the elements in the query. The other candidates are either about different sports (track, lifting, bike) or gymnastics.

The text says \"Traversing with parallel turns\" and \"Carved Turns\". It also mentions \"Snowboarding with parallel turns\" and \"Carved Turns\". Wait, the query mentions climbing snow, pulling sleds, tunnel, escalator, and sliding. But this video seems to be about skiing, maybe snowboarding. Let me check the description again. The first part of the video shows people skiing, but the text says \"Traversing with parallel turns\" and \"Carved Turns\". Hmm, but the query mentions climbing snow, pulling sleds, tunnel, escalator. Maybe this is a different activity. Wait, the query says \"In a black and white, people are climbing the snow and pulling snow sleds.\" So maybe the video shows people climbing and pulling sleds. But the candidate 1's description is about skiing, which might not include pulling sleds. Wait, the candidate 1's video description says \"Traversing with parallel turns\" and \"Carved Turns\", but the actual video might have snowboarding. Wait, the candidate 1's video starts with \"Traversing with parallel turns\" and then \"Carved Turns\". But the query mentions \"climbing the snow and pulling snow sleds\". So maybe this is not the right one.\n\nCandidate 2: The video starts with a black screen, then shows people in a river with snow. Wait, the description says \"people in a river with snow\" but the actual video shows people in a river with snow. Wait, the video description says \"people in a river with snow\" but the actual video shows people in a river with snow. Wait, the candidate 2's video starts with \"people in a river with snow\" but the actual video shows people in a river with snow. Wait, the description says \"people in a river with snow\" but the actual video shows people in a river with snow. Wait, maybe the video is about snow in a river? But the query is about snow climbing, sleds, tunnel, escalator. So this might not be relevant.\n\nCandidate 3: The video starts with a black screen, then shows people in a snowy area. The description says \"people in a snowy area\" and \"people in a snowy area\". Wait, the video description says \"people in a snowy area\" and \"people in a snowy area\". Wait, the actual video shows people in a snowy area. Wait, the description says \"people in a snowy area\" and \"people in a snowy area\".

Wait, the description says \"people in a snowy area\" and \"people in a snowy area\". Wait, maybe this is about snow. But the query mentions climbing, pulling sleds, tunnel, escalator. So maybe this is not the right one.\n\nCandidate 4: The video starts with a black screen, then shows a curling game. The description says \"curling game\" and \"people in a curling game\". But the query is about snow, climbing, sleds, tunnel, escalator. So this is about curling, which is a different sport. So this is probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate 5: The video starts with a black screen, then shows people in a snowy area. The description says \"people in a snowy area\" and \"people in a snowy area\". Wait, the actual video shows people in a snowy area.

Going down the hill in tubes.\n3. Coming up the hill attached to a rope.\n\nNow, looking at the candidates. Each candidate is a video, and I need to check which one matches the query best.\n\nLet's go through each candidate:\n\nCandidate [1]:\nThe video starts with a person walking on snow, then shows people sliding down a snowy hill on tubes. There's a person in a yellow jacket and another in a red jacket. The video ends with someone being pulled up the hill by a rope. Wait, the description says \"People are going down the hill of snow in tubes. People are coming up the hill attached to a rope.\" So this seems to fit. The first part is walking around, then tubes down, then rope up. But the query mentions \"walking around on the snow\" which might be the first part. Let me check the timestamps.\n\nThe video starts with a person walking on snow (0.2s), then shows people sliding down the hill (1.2s), then someone being pulled up by a rope (2.2s). Wait, the video description says \"People are walking around on the snow. People are going down the hill of snow in tubes. People are coming up the hill attached to a rope.\" So the first part is walking around, then tubes down, then rope up. So candidate [1] seems to match.\n\nCandidate [2]:\nThis video shows people sliding down a snowy hill on tubes. The description says \"People are going down the hill of snow in tubes.\" But the query also mentions \"People are walking around on the snow.\" In this video, the first part shows people walking around (maybe the first frame), but then they go down the hill. Wait, the video starts with people walking around, then sliding down. Wait, the video description says \"People are walking around on the snow. People are going down the hill of snow in tubes.

Wait, the video description for candidate [2] says: \"People are walking around on the snow. People are going down the hill of snow in tubes.

There's a dog playing with a frisbee, and the person throws it. The dog chases after it. Then, the camera falls over, and the person grabs it. Wait, the description says \"the camera falls over ad he walks over to grab it.\" So in the video, the camera falls over, which might be a part of the scene. Let me check the timestamps. The first part shows the person throwing the frisbee, the dog chasing, then the camera falls over. Hmm, maybe the video has the camera falling over as part of the action. The description mentions \"the camera falls over ad he walks over to grab it.\" So the video should have the camera falling over and the person grabbing the frisbee.\n\nLooking at the description of Candidate [1], the video starts with a dog and a person in a field.

Wait, the description says \"a girl and a dog playing with a frisbee.\" But the query mentions a person throwing a frisbee. However, the query says \"a person is seen with a dog in a large open field.\" So Candidate [2] has a girl, but the query says \"a person.\" Wait, the query says \"a person is seen with a dog,\" so the person is the one throwing the frisbee. But in Candidate [2], the video shows a girl and a dog. Wait, maybe the person is the girl? But the query says \"a person,\" which could be a girl. However, the query also mentions \"the person throws a frisbee off in the distance and the dog chases after it.\" So the person is throwing the frisbee. In Candidate [2], the girl is throwing the frisbee. Wait, but the video description for [2] says \"a girl and a dog playing with a frisbee.\" So the girl is the person. So maybe that's a possible match. But the query says \"a person,\" which could be a girl. However, the problem is that the query specifies \"a person is seen with a dog,\" so the person is the one with the dog. In Candidate [2], the girl is with the dog. But the query says \"the person throws a frisbee,\" so the person is the one throwing. So if the girl is the person, then that's a match.

When they're done dancing they depart and everyone watching begins clapping.\" So the key points are: man and woman dancing, people watching, then they finish and clapping.\n\nLooking at candidate [1], the video starts with them on stage, then they dance, and the audience claps. The description says \"the man and woman begin dancing while people on the sides of the dance floor are watching them.\" So in candidate [1], the man and woman are on the dance floor, and people are watching. Then they dance, and after that, the audience claps. That matches.\n\nCandidate [3] also shows a couple dancing on stage with people watching. The description says \"the man and woman begin dancing while people on the sides of the dance floor are watching them.\" So that's also a match.\n\nWait, but the query says \"the man and woman begin dancing while people on the sides of the dance floor are watching them.\" So the people are on the sides, not the front. In candidate [1], the description says \"the man and woman are on a dance floor and getting ready to dance. The man and woman begin dancing while people on the sides of the dance floor are watching them.\" So the people are on the sides. In candidate [1], the video shows the man and woman on the dance floor, and the audience is on the sides. Then they dance, and the audience claps.\n\nWait, but in candidate [1], the video starts with the man and woman on stage, then they dance. The description says \"the man and woman begin dancing while people on the sides of the dance floor are watching them.\" So the people are on the sides.

So, I need to find the most relevant video to the query: \"A man is shown putting plaster on the sides of a small, enclosed area.

The key elements here are:\n- A man putting plaster on the sides of a small enclosed area.\n- He holds an object in his hands.\n- He looks back towards the camera.\n\nNow, looking at the candidates:\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a man in a green shirt and white cap, then another person in a blue shirt. They seem to be outside, maybe near a building. There's a blue container and some activity. But the description mentions \"putting plaster on the sides of a small enclosed area.\" Wait, the first part of the video shows them moving around, maybe applying plaster? But the description here is a bit vague. Let me check the timestamps.\n\nWait, the video starts with a man in a green shirt, then another person in blue. They seem to be working on a structure. But the query is about plastering. Maybe this is a construction scene. However, the video description here is not clear. Let's check the next candidates.\n\nCandidate 2: This one shows hands holding a white cloth and a metal object. Then, the cloth is placed into a container. Wait, the video starts with hands handling a cloth and a metal object, then the cloth is placed into a container. But the query mentions a man putting plaster on the sides. This seems more like a different activity. Maybe the plaster is being applied, but the video here is about handling a cloth and a metal object. Not sure.\n\nCandidate 3: A man on a ladder applying plaster to the ceiling. The video shows him using a tool to apply plaster to the ceiling. Then, there's a person in the background. The description says \"putting plaster on the sides of a small, enclosed area.\" Wait, the ceiling is part of a small enclosed area. The man is on a ladder, so he's working on the ceiling. The query mentions \"sides of a small enclosed area,\" which could be the ceiling. Also, he holds an object in his hands. Wait, the video shows him holding a tool, maybe a trowel. But does he hold an object? The description says \"he holds an object in his hands.\" Let's check the timestamps.\n\nThe video starts with the man on the ladder, then he's applying plaster. The next part shows him looking back towards the camera. Wait, the video description says \"he holds an object in his hands and finally looks back towards the camera.\" So in the video, the man is holding something and then looks back. Let's check the timestamps.\n\nThe video starts with the man on the ladder, then he's applying plaster. The next part shows him looking back. So maybe this candidate matches.\n\nCandidate 4: A man in a blue shirt and red cap applying plaster to a wall. He's using a tool to apply plaster. The description says \"putting plaster on the sides of a small, enclosed area.\" The wall is part of a small enclosed area. He's holding a tool, which could be a trowel. Also, he's applying plaster to the wall. The query mentions \"he holds an object in his hands.\" So he's holding the trowel. Then, does he look back towards the camera? The video description says \"he holds an object in his hands and finally looks back towards the camera.\" So this candidate might fit.\n\nCandidate 5: A man in a red coat and blue hat applying plaster to a ceiling. He's holding a tool and a container. The description says \"putting plaster on the sides of a small, enclosed area.\" The ceiling is part of a small enclosed area. He's holding a container, maybe with plaster. He looks back towards the camera. So this also seems to fit.\n\nWait, but the query says \"a man is shown putting plaster on the sides of a small, enclosed area.\" So the area is enclosed, like a room or a small structure. Let's check each candidate's description.\n\nCandidate 1: The video shows people outside, maybe a construction site. The man in green shirt is moving around, but the description doesn't mention plaster. Maybe it's a different activity.\n\nCandidate 2: Hands handling a cloth and metal object. Not plaster.\n\nCandidate 3: Man on ladder applying plaster to ceiling. The ceiling is part of a small enclosed area. He's holding a tool (trowel), which is an object.

But in this candidate, the first part is a title card, then the volleyball game. So maybe the video starts with the title, but the actual content is the volleyball game. Wait, the video description says \"Jessica Playing Volleyball...\" so the video starts with the title, then shows the game. So the first part is the title, which is not the actual video content.

But in candidate 3, the girl is moving, and the dog is also moving. Wait, but the query mentions the girl moving her arms and legs while the dog moves in between. So maybe candidate 3 is relevant. Wait, but the description also mentions the girl using a frisbee. Let me check the candidate 3 video. The video shows a girl in a white shirt, a dog, and a frisbee. Wait, the query says the girl is in a black shirt. So maybe candidate 3 is not matching.\n\nCandidate 4: The video shows a girl in a black shirt, a dog, and a frisbee.

Each candidate is a video, and I need to check which one matches the query.\n\nLet's go through each candidate one by one.\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with a person in a maroon jacket, then cuts to a gymnasium. There's a girl in a black shirt and white shorts shooting a basketball. Wait, the description says \"several girls are on a court\" but the first part of the video shows a person speaking, then a girl shooting. But the query mentions \"several girls\" taking turns shooting hoops. However, the video here seems to have a person speaking first, then a girl shooting. But the query says \"several girls\" so maybe this is a different scenario. Wait, the first part of the video: the person in maroon jacket is speaking, then the scene shifts to a girl shooting. But the query is about girls taking turns shooting hoops. So maybe this video has a girl shooting, but does it have multiple girls taking turns? The description says \"several girls\" so maybe this is a candidate. But the video might not have multiple girls. Wait, the first part of the video: the person is speaking, then a girl in black shirt and white shorts shooting. Then another girl in black shirt and white shorts. Wait, the video description says \"several girls\" but the first part is a person speaking. Hmm, maybe the video starts with a person, then shows girls. Let me check the description again.\n\nWait, the candidate [1] video starts with a person in a maroon jacket speaking, then cuts to a gymnasium. Then a girl in black shirt and white shorts shooting a basketball. Then another girl in black shirt and white shorts. Wait, the description says \"several girls are on a court. The take turns shooting hoops.\" So maybe this video shows girls taking turns shooting. But the first part is a person speaking, which might not be part of the main action. However, the video shows girls shooting hoops. Let's see the timestamps.\n\nThe video starts with a person speaking (0-3 seconds), then cuts to a girl shooting (4-5 seconds), then another girl (5-6 seconds), etc. So maybe the girls are taking turns shooting. But the query says \"several girls are on a court. The take turns shooting hoops. Several make it in the hoop. They stand in a line.\"\n\nWait, the query mentions \"they stand in a line\" after shooting. So maybe the girls are shooting, then standing in a line. Let's check the video description.\n\nCandidate [1] video: The first part is a person speaking, then a girl shooting, then another girl, etc. But the description says \"several girls are on a court. The take turns shooting hoops.\" So maybe this video has multiple girls taking turns. However, the video might not have the \"they stand in a line\" part. Wait, the description for candidate [1] says \"several girls are on a court. The take turns shooting hoops. Several make it in the hoop. They stand in a line.\" Wait, the query is exactly that. Wait, the query is the description. Wait, no, the query is the description of what the user is asking. Wait, the user provided the query as \"Several girls are on a court. The take turns shooting hoops. Several make it in the hoop. They stand in a line.\" So the task is to find the video that matches this description.\n\nSo, the video must have girls on a court, taking turns shooting hoops, some making it in, and then standing in a line.\n\nLooking at candidate [1]: The video starts with a person speaking, then shows girls on the court. Wait, the first part of the video: the person is speaking, then the scene shifts to a gymnasium. Then a girl in black shirt and white shorts shooting. Then another girl. So maybe the girls are taking turns shooting. But the query says \"several girls\" so maybe multiple girls. However, the video description for candidate [1] says \"several girls are on a court. The take turns shooting hoops. Several make it in the hoop. They stand in a line.\" Wait, the query is the description, so the video must have those elements.\n\nWait, but the video description for candidate [1", "pred_order": [], "top1_correct": false, "gt_pos": 0, "index": 98}

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the query: \"This video shows viewers how to do a kickboxing elbow strike. First the man tells viewers to make the elbow sharp as possible and his hand stays inwards, elbow downwards, and his opposite hand is up. Next, he turns his legs and he continues to do the same thing.\"\n\nThe candidates are listed as [1] to [5], each with their own video descriptions. My job is to figure out which one matches the query best.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the query. The key points are:\n\n1. It's a kickboxing elbow strike.\n2. The man explains how to do it: make the elbow sharp, hand inwards, elbow down, opposite hand up.\n3. Then he turns his legs and continues.\n\nSo, the video should demonstrate a kickboxing elbow strike technique. Let's look at each candidate:\n\nCandidate [1]: The video starts with \"Removal & Replacement of Existing Shingle\". The description shows someone working on a roof, removing shingles. There's a person using a tool, maybe a hammer, and a house. This seems like a DIY home repair video. Not related to kickboxing. So probably not this one.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video starts with a logo \"Howcast\" and shows a man in a red shirt doing boxing moves. The description mentions \"Howcast\" and the man is punching a heavy bag. The title is \"Howcast\" but the content is about boxing. Wait, the query is about kickboxing elbow strike. The video here shows someone punching a heavy bag, which is boxing, but the specific technique described in the query is an elbow strike. However, the video might be about boxing, but the query specifies kickboxing. Wait, the query says \"kickboxing elbow strike\", so maybe it's a different sport. But the candidate [2] is about boxing. Wait, the query says \"kickboxing\", which is a variation of boxing. But the video in candidate [2] shows someone punching a heavy bag, which is typical for boxing or kickboxing. However, the description says \"Howcast\" and the man is doing boxing moves. But the query is about an elbow strike. Let me check the description again.\n\nWait, the query says: \"First the man tells viewers to make the elbow sharp as possible and his hand stays inwards, elbow downwards, and his opposite hand is up. Next, he turns his legs and he continues to do the same thing.\"\n\nSo the key is the elbow strike technique. The video in candidate [2] shows a man doing boxing moves, but does it include an elbow strike? The description says \"punching a heavy bag\", which is a common boxing technique. But the query specifies an elbow strike. So maybe candidate [2] is not the right one.\n\nCandidate [3]: The video starts with \"Howcast\" and shows a man doing a kickboxing move. Wait, the description says \"Howcast\" and the title is \"On Balance at a Block\" and \"Obstacles of a Kick\". Wait, the description says \"On Balance at a Block\" and \"Obstacles of a Kick\". Wait, the video is about balance and blocks in kickboxing? Wait, the description says \"On Balance at a Block\" and \"Obstacles of a Kick\". Hmm, maybe it's about kickboxing techniques. Wait, the video shows a man doing a kickboxing move. Wait, the description says \"Howcast\" and the video shows a man in a red shirt doing a kickboxing move. Wait, the video is about \"On Balance at a Block\" and \"Obstacles of a Kick\". Wait, maybe it's a different technique. Wait, the query is about an elbow strike. So if the video is about balance and blocks, maybe it's not the elbow strike. Let me check the description again.\n\nWait, the candidate [3] description says: \"Howcast\" and the video shows a man doing a kickboxing move. Wait, the description says \"On Balance at a Block\" and \"Obstacles of a Kick\". Wait, maybe it's a different technique. Wait, the query is about an elbow strike.

Wait, the description says \"Howcast\" and the man is punching a heavy bag. Wait, the description says \"Howcast\" and the video shows a man in a red shirt doing boxing moves.

The boy is sitting, and there's a drum set. But wait, the description mentions a studio. The background here seems more like a home setting, maybe a bedroom or a living room. Also, the boy is using his foot to play a base drum. Wait, the video starts with the boy sitting, but the description says he's playing in a studio. Hmm, maybe the studio aspect is not clear here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the video [1] has the boy sitting, but the description says \"in a studio.\" Maybe the setting is a studio, but the background is a room with a floral pattern. Not sure. Let's check the other candidates.\n\nCandidate [2]: A boy in a blue shirt and red shorts playing drums. The setting is a dark room, which might be a studio.

Let's check the video [2]. The boy is standing, but the description says he's in a studio. The video [2] shows him playing drums in a dark room, which could be a studio. Wait, but the boy is standing, but the query says \"switches stance to play the drums behind him.\" So maybe he's moving from front to back. Let's see.\n\nWait, the query says \"uses his foot to play a base drum.\" So the boy is using his foot to hit the base drum. In video [2], the boy is playing the drums with his hands, but maybe he's using his foot. Wait, no. Wait, the description says \"uses his foot to play a base drum.\" So the boy is using his foot to hit the base drum. Let me check the video [2]. The video shows the boy in a blue shirt, red shorts, playing a drum set. The boy is standing, and he's using his hands to hit the drums.

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query describes a cute baby girl named Jessica swinging on a little baby swing in the garden near her house. After some time, she gets put into her play pin where she just stands up and smiles.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each candidate video and see which one matches the description.\n\nStarting with candidate [1]: The video starts with a blue slide, then a woman kneeling next to it. Wait, the description says a baby girl swinging. But the first part shows a slide, not a swing. Then there's a woman with a baby. Wait, the video starts with a blue slide, then a woman in a yellow shirt and brown pants kneeling next to it. Then she's holding a blue toy. Wait, maybe the baby is there? Let me check again. The first part of the video shows a blue slide, then a woman kneeling next to it, then a baby in a pink outfit. Wait, the video starts with a slide, then a woman with a baby. Hmm, maybe the baby is on the slide? But the query is about a swing. So maybe this video isn't about a swing. Let me check the timestamps. The video starts with a blue slide, then a woman kneeling next to it, then a baby in a pink outfit. Wait, maybe the baby is on the slide? But the query says a swing. So maybe this is not the right video.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video starts with a girl in a pink dress on a swing. Wait, the first frame shows a girl in a pink dress on a swing. Then she's swinging. The description says a baby girl, but here it's a girl. Wait, the query mentions a baby girl named Jessica. So maybe this is the right one. Let's check the details. The video shows a girl in a pink dress on a swing, swinging. The description says \"a cute baby girl who's name is Jessica\". Wait, but the video here is a girl, not a baby. Wait, maybe the baby is a girl. Wait, the query says \"baby girl\", so maybe this is the one. Let's see the next part: \"After a while of the baby swinging, she gets put into her play pin where she just stands up and smiles.\" Wait, the video in candidate [2] shows a girl swinging, but does it mention being put into a play pin? The video description says \"After a while of the baby swinging, she gets put into her play pin where she just stands up and smiles.\" Wait, the video in candidate [2] shows a girl swinging, but maybe the play pin part is not there. Wait, the video starts with a girl in a pink dress on a swing, then she's swinging. The description says \"she gets put into her play pin where she just stands up and smiles.\" So maybe the video in candidate [2] is the one. Wait, but the query says \"baby girl\", so maybe the girl in candidate [2] is a baby. Let's check the timestamps. The video starts with a girl in a pink dress on a swing. The first frame shows a girl in a pink dress on a swing. Then she's swinging. The description says \"a cute baby girl who's name is Jessica\". So maybe the girl in candidate [2] is the baby girl. Wait, but the video in candidate [2] is a girl, but the query says \"baby girl\". So maybe this is the right one.\n\nCandidate [3]: The video starts with a black screen with text \"First time on a swing\". Then a baby in a pink hat and pink outfit on a swing. The description says \"a cute baby girl who's name is Jessica\". The baby in this video is wearing a pink hat and pink outfit. The text says \"First time on a swing\", which matches the query's \"swinging on a little baby swing\". The baby is on a swing, and the text says \"First time on a swing\", which might indicate that this is the first time she's on the swing. The query says \"she gets put into her play pin where she just stands up and smiles.\" Wait, the video in candidate [3] shows the baby on the swing, but does it show her being put into a play pin? Let me check the video description. The video starts with a black screen with text, then the baby on the swing. The video ends with \"Thanks for watching the video\". So maybe this video is about the baby on the swing, but does it mention the play pin part? The query says \"she gets put into her play pin where she just stands up and smiles.\" So maybe the video in candidate [3] is the one.

So, I need to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query describes a man with long hair looking at the camera, brushing his hair all around while looking down, then turning around to finish brushing and waving. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each candidate video to see which one matches the description.\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a man with long hair. He's looking at the camera, then starts brushing his hair. The description mentions he brushes all around while looking down, then turns around and waves. Let me check the timestamps. The first part shows him brushing his hair, and then he turns around. The video ends with him waving. That seems to match the query.\n\nCandidate 2: This one is about a woman brushing her hair with a hair tie. The text says \"You can't get a hair tie for free.\" Wait, the description here is about a woman, not a man. The query specifies a man, so this might not be relevant.\n\nCandidate 3: This is a video about a man in a room, but the description mentions \"NATS DONATION\" and then a woman in a blue shirt. The main action here is a man running and then a woman brushing hair. Wait, the video starts with \"NATS DONATION\" and then shows a man in a room. The description says \"a man with long hair is seen looking at the camera...\" but this video might not have the man brushing his hair. Let me check again. The video shows a man in a room, but the main action is a woman brushing hair. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nCandidate 4: This is about \"Caring for the Hair Pieces\" and a woman brushing hair. The description here is about a woman, not a man. So this is probably not relevant.\n\nCandidate 5: This video shows a man in a room, but the description is about a woman. Wait, the video starts with a man in a room, but the main action is a woman brushing hair. Wait, the description says \"a man with long hair is seen looking at the camera...\" but the video here shows a woman. So this might not match.\n\nWait, let me recheck each candidate.\n\nCandidate 1: The video starts with a man with long hair. He looks at the camera, brushes his hair, turns around, and waves. That's exactly the description.\n\nCandidate 2: A woman brushing hair with a hair tie. Not a man.\n\nCandidate 3: A man in a room, but the main action is a woman brushing hair. So maybe not.\n\nCandidate 4: A woman brushing hair. Not a man.\n\nCandidate 5: A woman brushing hair. Not a man.\n\nSo only Candidate 1 matches the description of a man with long hair brushing his hair, looking at the camera, turning around, and waving. The other candidates either have a woman or don't match the description.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Candidate 1, which is index 1.\n</think>\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "pred_order": [1], "top1_correct": true, "gt_pos": 1, "index": 104}

He's wearing a black tank top and has tattoos. He's climbing up, then jumps to the top, gives a thumbs up, and stands at the bottom talking to the camera. That's exactly what the query describes. The sequence matches: climbing, jumping to the top, thumbs up, then talking to the camera. So this seems like a perfect match.\n\nCandidate [3]: The video starts with a logo, then shows two people climbing a rock wall. Wait, the description says \"a man is climbing up a rock wall.\" But the video here shows two people, one climbing and another standing. The query mentions a man, but maybe it's a group. However, the key part is the man jumping to the top and giving a thumbs up. But in this video, it's two people. Also, the video ends with a copyright notice. The description says \"a man is climbing,\" but maybe it's a group. However, the query specifies \"a man,\" so maybe it's not the right candidate.

The description mentions \"the man does a trick and lands with one foot on the board.\" So this seems to fit.\n\nCandidate 5: The video shows a person doing a trick, then the text \"GO GET THE VIDEO NOW AT BRAILLESKATEBOARDING.COM\". The description mentions \"the skateboarder rubs the top of his grip tape with his hand.\" So this is relevant.\n\nWait, the query also mentions \"the skateboarder rubs the top of his grip tape with his hand.\" So the action of rubbing the grip tape is important.

So, the task is to find the most relevant video to the given query. The query describes a man in a kitchen making lemon juice, juicing a lemon, washing the citrus juice, slicing the lemon, taking out seeds, blending it, pouring into a pitcher, and stirring.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each candidate video and see which one matches the steps described in the query.\n\nStarting with Candidate [1]: The video starts with a dog, then shows a kitchen scene with lemons and a pitcher. Wait, the first part says \"Blogging With Hunn\" but then the next frames show lemons, a pitcher, and a dog. Hmm, the description mentions a man making lemon juice, but the first part is a dog. Wait, maybe the video starts with the dog, but then shows the lemon preparation. Wait, the video starts with a dog, then a lemon and a pitcher. Wait, the first part of the video might be a dog, but the actual lemon preparation is later. Wait, the video description says: [1] video: starts with a dog, then shows a kitchen with lemons, a pitcher, and a dog. Wait, maybe the video is about a dog, but the query is about a man making lemon juice. So maybe Candidate [1] is not relevant because it's a dog in the video.\n\nCandidate [2]: The video starts with \"A POT OF WATER\" then \"First Cut All Lemons in Half\" and \"After That Juice Them\". Then it shows a person cutting lemons, juicing them, and putting them in a blender. Wait, the steps here: \"First Cut All Lemons in Half\", \"After That Juice Them\", \"Pour into a Pot\", \"Removing the Seeds\", \"Leave to Cool\", \"Blend\", etc. Wait, the query mentions \"juices a lemon and washes the citrus juice\" but the candidate [2] shows cutting lemons, juicing, removing seeds, blending. Wait, the query says \"the man juices a lemon and washes the citrus juice\" but the candidate [2] says \"After That Juice Them\" and \"Pour into a Pot\" and \"Removing the Seeds\". Wait, maybe the steps here are similar. Let me check again.\n\nCandidate [2] description: \"First Cut All Lemons in Half\" then \"After That Juice Them\", \"Pour into a Pot\", \"Removing the Seeds\", \"Leave to Cool\", \"Blend\", etc. Wait, the query says \"the man juices a lemon and washes the citrus juice\" but the candidate [2] shows cutting lemons, juicing, removing seeds, blending. Wait, maybe the \"washing\" part is not exactly there. Wait, the query says \"the man juices a lemon and washes the citrus juice\". Wait, maybe \"washing\" is a typo or maybe it's \"washing the lemon\" but the candidate [2] shows cutting lemons, juicing, removing seeds, blending. Hmm.\n\nCandidate [3]: The video shows a person cutting lemons, putting them in a glass, then blending. Wait, the description says: \"a person cuts a lemon, puts it in a glass, then blends it\". Wait, the query mentions \"slices a lemon in slices and takes out the seeds. He puts the sliced lemon in a blender and blends it.\" So Candidate [3] shows cutting lemons, putting in a glass, then blending. Wait, but the query says \"slices a lemon in slices and takes out the seeds\". So maybe Candidate [3] is about slicing and then blending. Wait, the video description for [3] says: \"a person cuts a lemon, puts it in a glass, then blends it\". Wait, maybe the steps here are: cutting, then blending. But the query mentions slicing and taking out seeds. So maybe Candidate [3] is not exactly matching.\n\nCandidate [4]: The video shows a man in a kitchen, cutting lemons, putting them in a blender. Wait, the description says: \"a man in a kitchen, cutting lemons, putting them in a blender\". Wait, the query mentions \"slices a lemon in slices and takes out the seeds. He puts the sliced lemon in a blender and blends it.\" So Candidate [4] shows the man cutting lemons, putting them in a blender. Wait, but the query says \"slices a lemon in slices and takes out the seeds\". So maybe the candidate [4] is about slicing and then blending. Wait, the video description for [4] says: \"a man in a kitchen, cutting lemons, putting them in a blender\". Wait, the steps here: \"a man cuts lemons, puts them in a blender\". Wait, but the query mentions \"slices a lemon in slices and takes out the seeds\". So maybe the candidate [4] is about slicing and then blending.
