Wait, the description mentions a man swinging a ball (like a discus or hammer, but discus is a throw). Wait, the query says \"swings a ball attached to a rope\"—maybe a hammer throw? Wait, hammer throw involves swinging a heavy ball (hammer) around the query is about a man swinging a ball (like a hammer or discus) around his body, then throwing it. Wait, the query says \"swings a ball attached to a rope\"—so maybe a hammer throw? Wait, hammer throw is a track event where you swing a heavy ball (hammer) around your body. Let's check the actions:\n\nIn [1], there's a man swinging a ball (maybe a hammer) around his body, then throwing it. The video shows him in a track setting, with people around, and there's a replay.

The sequence matches: standing, swinging, throwing, and looking away. The netting is key here.\n\n- Candidate [2]: A person in a red shirt, throwing, but no netting or spinning. The action is throwing, not the described sequence.\n\n- Candidate [3]: A person in a black top, throwing, but no netting or spinning. Not matching.\n\n- Candidate [4]: A person in a blue shirt, throwing, but no netting or spinning. Doesn't fit.\n\n- Candidate [5]: A person in white, swinging, but no netting or spinning. The netting is there, but the spinning and throwing action isn't as clear.\n\nNow, check the query details: \"standing behind a netting area\" (so netting is present), \"swing in her hand\" (swinging motion), \"moving in slow motion\" (the video shows slow motion), \"throwing the object around while she spins\" (spinning during throw), \"finally throw it off into the distance while looking away\" (looking away after throw).\n\nCandidate [1] has the netting, the woman is swinging, and the sequence of actions (swinging, throwing, looking away) matches.

In candidate [1], the man is lifting the barbell and then carrying it over his head. Let's check the details.\n\nWait, candidate [1] has a man in black shirt and gray pants, lifting a barbell. The query says \"carrying a barbel with two 15 lbs black metal plates\". Let's check the weight. The query mentions two 15 lbs plates, so the barbell should have two 15 lbs plates. In candidate [1], the man is lifting a barbell, but does it have two 15 lbs plates? Maybe the barbell is two 15 lbs plates, so the weight is correct.\n\nWait, candidate [5] has a man in black shirt and white shorts, lifting weights. Not matching the gray pants.\n\nWait, let's check candidate [1] again. The video in [1] shows a man in black shirt and gray pants lifting a barbell. The query says \"carrying a barbel with two 15 lbs black metal plates\". Let's check the weight. The query mentions two 15 lbs plates, so the barbell should have two 15 lbs plates. In candidate [1], the man is lifting a barbell, which might have two 15 lbs plates. The action of lifting and carrying over his head matches the query.\n\nWait, maybe candidate [1] is the most relevant. Let's check other candidates.\n\nCandidate [2]: A man in gray shirt and red pants, lifting weights. Not matching the black shirt and gray pants.\n\nCandidate [3]: A man in red shirt and black shorts, lifting weights. Not matching.\n\nCandidate [4]: A man in black shirt and black pants, lifting weights. Not matching the gray pants.\n\nCandidate [5]: A man in black shirt and white shorts, lifting weights. Not matching the gray pants.\n\nSo candidate [1] is the only one with a man in black shirt and gray pants, lifting a barbell. The query mentions \"carrying a barbel with two 15 lbs black metal plates\", which might be the weight. Let's check the video in [1]: the man is lifting a barbell, which could have two 15 lbs plates. The action of lifting and carrying over his head matches the query.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant video is [1].\n</think>\n<answer>1</answer>", "pred_order": [1], "top1_correct": false, "gt_pos": 0, "index": 70}

Wait, the query says \"an older man with a cigarette in his mouth is standing close to her watching and smiling.\" In [2], the man is standing close, and in [3], he's also there.

[5] is about a man with an accordion, not a woman. [1] is a man with saxophone. So [2] and [3] are the candidates. Now, [2] has a woman playing, outdoors, with a man watching. [3] also has a woman playing, but maybe the man is not as close. Wait, [2] shows the woman playing, and the man is there.

There's a coach talking to players, and two players might be doing rock-paper-scissors. Wait, the first part is about players discussing, coaches talking, and two players in the back playing rock-paper-scissors. Let's check the sequence.\n\n- Candidate [2]: Basketball game, indoor. No rock-paper-scissors, just players and coaches. Doesn't match.\n\n- Candidate [3]: Rugby or field sport, but no rock-paper-scissors, just players running. Not matching.\n\n- Candidate [4]: Cricket, players on a field, but no coaches or rock-paper-scissors. Cricket is different.\n\n- Candidate [5]: Lacrosse game, players on a field, but no coaches or rock-paper-scissors. Lacrosse is a sport, but the query mentions men in jerseys, coaches, and rock-paper-scissors.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.

The last part might have two players playing rock-paper-scissors. Let's check the timestamps. The video starts with people on a field, then coaches, then maybe the rock-paper-scissors.\n\nWait, Candidate [1] has a sequence: first, people on a field (maybe soccer), then coaches talking to players (like a coach and players), then maybe the rock-paper-scissors. Let's check the description.\n\nWait, the query is about a field, men in jerseys, coaches, and rock-paper-scissors. Candidate [1] has a scene where players are on a field, coaches are present, and there's a moment where two players might be playing rock-paper-scissors. Let's confirm.\n\nCandidate [1] has a sequence: starts with people on a field (maybe soccer), then coaches talking to players (like a coach and players), then maybe the rock-paper-scissors. The other candidates don't have the rock-paper-scissors part.\n\nWait, Candidate [5] is lacrosse, but no rock-paper-scissors. Candidate [1] is more likely to have the rock-paper-scissors. Let's check the description again.\n\nWait, the query says \"two players in the back play rock paper scissors.\" So, in Candidate [1], there's a scene where two players are in the back, maybe playing rock-paper-scissors. Let's see the video description: the first part shows people on a field, then coaches talking, then maybe the rock-paper-scissors.\n\nWait, Candidate [1] is the only one that has a field setting, players, coaches, and possibly rock-paper-scissors.

Wait, the query says \"a father and son ride down on a single inner tube down a slope.\" In [1], there's a scene where a father and son are on a single inner tube, which matches. Also, the query mentions \"a family rides together on a set of inner tubes attached with a rope down the hill.\" In [1], there's a group on inner tubes, maybe with a rope? Let's check the video description. The video shows people on inner tubes, sliding down a hill, and there's a family (maybe father and son) involved.

Let's confirm:\n\n- Query: \"Children stand holding inner tubes on a flat area. A family rides together on a set of inner tubes attached with a rope down the hill. The family slides back and forth against a ramp at the bottom of a hill. People are pulled on a tow line up a slope riding on inner tubes.

The query is about a baby rinsing a cup, using a sponge, asking for soap, pouring it, adult taking soap, pouring out, rinsing, dropping in sink. Let's check candidate [3]: The child is washing dishes, using a sponge, rinsing. But the query mentions a baby and adult. Wait, maybe candidate [3] is the closest. Wait, no, the query says \"baby\" but candidate [3] is a child (maybe a baby). Wait, the query says \"baby\", so maybe candidate [3] is the one. Wait, no, let's check the actions:\n\nIn candidate [3], the child is at the sink, using a sponge to wash dishes. The actions include rinsing, using a sponge. But the query mentions a baby asking for soap, pouring it, etc. Wait, maybe candidate [3] is the most relevant because it involves a child (baby) washing dishes, which includes rinsing and using a sponge. The other candidates don't involve a baby or the specific actions. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the query says \"a baby rinse a cup. She grabs a sponge and rinses it and her cup. She asks for the dish soap and pours it in her cup. the adult takes the soap from the baby. She pours it out and rinses her cup. She drops the cup in the sink and gets off her ladder.\"\n\nWait, the query mentions \"she\" (the baby) and \"the adult\". So the baby is doing the actions, and the adult is involved. Let's check candidate [3]: The child is washing dishes, which involves using a sponge, rinsing, but no adult. Wait, maybe candidate [3] is the closest. Wait, no, maybe candidate [3] is the one. Wait, let's check the other candidates:\n\nCandidate [1]: A baby and adult at a table, but no sponge, soap, or rinsing. The baby is drinking, not rinsing a cup.\n\nCandidate [2]: A woman washing dishes, no baby.\n\nCandidate [3]: A child (baby) washing dishes, using a sponge, rinsing. The actions are similar to the query, but the query mentions an adult taking soap, which isn't in candidate [3]. Wait, maybe candidate [3] is the best match because it involves a child (baby) doing the rinsing and sponge use, which is part of the query.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the actions again:\n\n- Rinsing a cup: candidate [3] has the child rinsing dishes (which are cups), using a sponge.\n\n- Asking for soap: not in candidate [3].\n\n- Adult taking soap: not in candidate [3].\n\nWait, maybe candidate [3] is the closest. Wait, no, maybe candidate [3] is the one. Wait, let's check the other candidates again.\n\nWait, candidate [3] is a child washing dishes, which includes rinsing and using a sponge. The query mentions \"rinses her cup\", which is similar to rinsing dishes. The other candidates don't involve a baby or the specific actions. So maybe candidate [3] is the most relevant.\n</think>\n<answer>3</answer>", "pred_order": [3], "top1_correct": false, "gt_pos": 0, "index": 112}
